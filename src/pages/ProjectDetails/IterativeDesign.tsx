        <h2>Sketching and Wireframing ·ù∞‚úçüèª</h2>
        <p>
          Our design process began with low-fidelity sketches and wireframes to
          define core functionality and user flow. These early iterations helped
          us focus on structure over styling, identifying the primary components
          needed on each screen‚Äîsuch as navigation, project cards, and content
          sections. We were guided by user-centered design principles,
          prioritizing clarity, hierarchy, and ease of navigation. For instance,
          the layout features clear divisions, mimicking common patterns users
          are already familiar with, which improves usability and intuitiveness.
          We drew inspiration from modern, minimalistic portfolio layouts and
          peer feedback with content-focused designs. Some objective decisions
          we made overall included: - A Consistent Color Palette orange + beige
          tones: Promotes visual identity and emotional warmth. - Clear
          Typography Hierarchy: Primary bold headers and secondary fonts are
          used consistently for readability and emphasis. - Component
          Reusability: Buttons, cards, and headers follow a style guide,
          enabling scalable design across the app. Decisions within the pages
          included: - Clear Generate Course instructions, positioned at the
          center with strong contrast, guiding users to the app‚Äôs main action. -
          A Popular Courses Carousel: Gives users a quick preview of content;
          encourages exploration and boosts engagement. - Minimal Top Nav:
          Focuses attention on central interaction instead of distracting
          options. - Structured Content Hierarchy. E.g. in the course page:
          Overview ‚Üí Lessons ‚Üí Knowledge Check flow makes it cognitively easy to
          process. - Progress Tracking with Visual Feedback and a roadmap/
          tracker map (not in figma file but in wireframes), lets users
          understand where they are in the course and what is next. - Use of
          Color for Feedback: Orange = interactive/important actions, Green =
          success or helpful info, keeping visual language consistent. -
          Category Segmentation for courses (e.g. K-12, College, Other), helps
          users locate what they need faster. - The visual folder system in the
          my notes page mimics a real world filing system, making it intutive
          for users.

        <h2>Hi-Fi Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          We developed high fidelity prototypes for the webpages based on the
          wireframes. For the Hi-Fi prototypes, we eliminated the About Us page,
          the checkout page, the progress tracker page and the creators page
          because we thought these were not part of the main interaction of our
          website. In addition to the pages represented in the wireframes, we
          also added a Course page for when the users are studying a course.
        </p>
        <p>Our design style guide is as follows:</p>
        <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row", gap: "20px" }}>
          <img
            style={{ width: "50%", marginBottom: "20px" }}
            src={StyleGuide}
            alt="design style guide"
          />
          <div>
            In the design style guide, we included the logo, text font, UI
            elements and color palette with a varied hue of orange.
